Hello there.

This is Cenk TÃ¼ysÃ¼z (/ËˆdÊ’É›Å‹k tu:jsu:z/). I'm a postdoc @ CERN working on quantum machine learning. I love working on multidisciplinary projects, and in fact, this is what brought me to quantum computing. I enjoy working with people from all around the world. Below is a non-exhaustive list of my current research interests. Feel free to reach out via your favorite platform.

## Research Interests:
- Generative learning with QML
- Quantum machine learning (QML); trainability QML models, barren plateaus, warm starts.
- Geometric machine learning; representation theory, category theory
- Mitigating hardware noise to maximize utility of current hardware
- Physics simulations with Quantum Computing
- High Energy Physics applications of Quantum Computing

You can find more details about me on my website ðŸ‘‰ [cnktysz.github.io](https://cnktysz.github.io/)
