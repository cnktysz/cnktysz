Hi, my nameâ€™s Cenk TÃ¼ysÃ¼z (/ËˆdÊ’É›Å‹k tu:jsu:z/), and Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in quantum computing. I love working on multidisciplinary projects, and in fact, this is what brought me to quantum computing. I enjoy working with people from all around the world and am always looking for new collaboration opportunities to broaden my horizons. Below is a non-exhaustive list of my current research interests. Feel free to reach out via your favorite platform.

## Research Interests:
- Quantum machine learning (QML); trainability and expressive capacity of QML models, barren plateaus, warm starting.
- Generative learning with QML
- Geometric machine learning; representation theory, category theory
- Understanding hardware noise to maximize utility of current hardware
- Physics simulations with Quantum Computing
- High Energy Physics applications of Quantum Computing
